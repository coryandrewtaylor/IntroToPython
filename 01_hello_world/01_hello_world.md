## Administrivia

### Course GitHub Repo

I maintain my copy of the course notes and code at https://github.com/coryandrewtayor/IntroToPython. When we make changes during a lesson, I'll do my best to push them to master within 36 hours of class.

If you catch any errors, typos, or other areas where the course could be improved, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/coryandrewtaylor/IntroToPython/issues)! I'd also encourage you to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the course repo so that you can make your own notes and changes along the way.

### Attendance Policy

Per AIM's policy, I'll be taking attendance each class. But I'm not a stickler. Life gets in the way sometimes!

If you're going to be more than 15 minutes late, need to leave early, or have to miss class entirely, no worries--just shoot me an email and we'll work to get you caught back up.

---

### Class Time

Each class session runs for four hours: 5:30--9:30 pm.

The first hour/hour-and-a-half of class is devoted to reviewing the previous lesson. I'm relying on you to come prepared with questions! Otherwise, it's just an hour-long lecture on things you've already heard, and nobody wants that.

We'll have three 10-minute breaks interspersed during the class period. I try to time things so that we have a break at the end of the first, second, and third hours. Though, depending on the flow of the lesson, we may have to shift them around occasionally.

## Main Idea of Python: Objects

---

### Objects Can Be Things (Data)

What is data?

It can be a single item, like the number `0` or the word `"Python"`.

It can be a bunch of items, like a list:

```python
["a", "b", "c"]
```

or a dictionary:

```python
{
    "python": "The most broadly useful programming language out there",
    "sql": "A beautiful language for databases",
    "everything else": "lol all kinda tied for last place tbh",
}
```
